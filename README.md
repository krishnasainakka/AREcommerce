# AR-Ecommerce

## Project Idea
AR-Ecommerce is revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape with its cutting-edge features that redefine the online shopping experience. Leveraging 3D visualization through Google Model Viewer, users can interact with products from all angles, boosting understanding and confidence in purchase decisions. Augmented Reality (AR) capabilities take immersion further, allowing users to virtually place products in their space, minimizing uncertainty and enhancing satisfaction. 

The platform’s standout feature is its 3D T-shirt designer, empowering users to customize their apparel with intuitive controls and real-time previews. Powered by OpenAI’s DALLE model, AR-Ecommerce generates lifelike images of user-designed T-shirts, ensuring accurate representations and bolstering confidence in personalized creations.

Security is paramount with seamless authentication via Clerk SDK, enhancing trust and facilitating smooth login experiences. Integrated Stripe payment processing guarantees secure transactions, catering to diverse payment preferences and enhancing overall convenience. With AR-Ecommerce, users embark on a journey of unparalleled engagement and personalization, transforming the way they shop online.
